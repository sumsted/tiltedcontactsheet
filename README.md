#Tilted Contact Sheet

This was inspired by a photographer's work. This photographer had a jig that he'd use to take hundreds of photographs
of a scene. In some sections of the scene he would rate the camera slightly. This distortion had an interesting effect
on the image. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the artists name. I do remember that one of his images was of a castle.

This code creates a similar effect byt cutting up an image into frames, rotating some of the frames and then
combining the frames to form a contact sheet.

There is a problem in that the axis of rotation for affected frames is the center of the large image. Instead the center
of rotation should be in the affected frame.
