#Tilted Contact Sheet

I saw a photographer setup this jig that allowed him to split a complete scene into separate frames. In some sections of 
the scene he would rotate the camera slightly. This distortion had an interesting effect on the image. 
Unfortunately, I don't recall the artist's name. 

This code attempts to create a similar effect by cutting up an image into frames, rotating some of the frames and then
combining the frames to form a contact sheet.
